## ‚ùå Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Failed to save profile"
**Cause**: Supabase tables not created or RLS policies blocking access

1. Make sure you ran the SQL schema in Supabase
2. Verify tables exist in Table Editor
3. Check browser console for detailed error message
4. Share the error with me if it persists

---

### Issue 2: Sign-in button doesn't open modal
**Cause**: Clerk configuration issue

**Solution**:
1. Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check `.env.local` has the correct Clerk keys
3. Restart dev server

---

### Issue 3: Page keeps loading after sign-in
**Cause**: Middleware authentication issue (network fetch failure)

**Solution**:
- This should be fixed in production deployment
- For local testing, you might still see some delays
- Wait 30 seconds and try refreshing

---

### Issue 4: Google Maps not showing on farm location picker
**Cause**: Google Maps API key issue

**Solution**:
- This is optional for testing
- You can skip adding a farm for now
- Or manually enter location coordinates
